# Excel-Python-introduction
Small project to learn work with excel in python

**readCensusExcel.py** - Tabulates population and number of census tracts for each county.

We have a spreadsheet of data from the 2010 US Census and we need to going through its thousands of rows to count both the total population and the number of census tracts for each county.

This is what **readCensusExcel.py** does:
  1. Reads the data from the Excel spreadsheet
  2. Counts the number of census tracts in each county
  3. Counts the total population of each county
  4. Writes the result to a **census2010.py** file
  
  
  
**updateProduce.py** - Corrects costs in produce sales spreadsheet.

Program will look through the spreadsheet, find specific kinds of produce, and update their prices.
  
**updateProduce.py** does the following:
  1. Loops over all the rows
  2. If the row is for garlic, celery, or lemons, changes the price
