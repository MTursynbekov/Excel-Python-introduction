# Excel-Python-introduction
Small project to learn work with excel in python

We have a spreadsheet of data from the 2010 US Census and we need to going through its thousands of rows to count both the total population and the number of census tracts for each county.

**readCensusExcel.py** - Tabulates population and number of census tracts for each county.
This is what my program does:
  1. Reads the data from the Excel spreadsheet
  2. Counts the number of census tracts in each county
  3. Counts the total population of each county
  4. Writes the result to a **census2010.py** file
